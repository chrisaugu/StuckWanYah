Rating Algorithm:
- Rating girls based on their hotness

Ranking algrithm is a formula for finding an object that is strong in the same class.
Ranking works by comparing ratings of two objects of the same class

ELO Rating System:
Ea = 1/(1 + 10(Ra - Rb)1400)
Eb = 1/(1 + 10(Rb - Ra)1400)

give each girl a base rating of 1400 at any given time 
girl a has a Rating Ra
girl b has a Rating Rb

@OutOfScopeOfAlgorithm: 
  store each friends along with the counts of their hotness
  retrieve each friends with their hotness counts
  perform ranking function based on the hotness counts
  rank friends in descending order from hottest to not so hot

1: input friends
2: compare friend's hotness with other friend's hotness
3: rank friends with the most hotness based
4: 

Inspired from Facemash, is there a desktop application that:
1: Scans the pictures in a folder
2: Shows two random pictures and asks me to choose which one I prefer
3: The picture I prefer will be the winner and gets a higher ratings (as in chess ratings), while the losing picture loses ratings
4: Repeats steps 2 and 3 indefinitely till it decides the ratings for the pictures are accurate
5: Sorts the pictures by their rating


// 
var rank = 0.00;
var Time = Date;
s = pics.
order = Math.log10([s.abs, 1].max);

if s > 0
  sign = 1
else if s < 0 
  sign = -1
else 
  sign = 0

td = (Time.now - post.created_at)

hot(ups, downs, date)
  var s = ups - downs
  var sign, date = Date, order
  order = Math.log10([s.abs, 1].max)
  if (s > 0)
    then sign = 1 
  else if (s < 0)
    then sign = -1
  else 
    sign = 0
  seconds = date.now - 
  (sign * order + seconds / 45000).sqrt(7)
