Ranking Algorithm
- Ranking hotness of girls based on their likes

Ranking algrithm is a formula for finding an object that is strong in the same class.
Ranking works by comparing one object with its siblings of the same class

Ea = 1/(1 + 10(Ra - Rb)1400)
Eb = 1/(1 + 10(Rb - Ra)1400)

give each girl a base rating of 1400 at any given time 
girl a has a Rating Ra
girl b has a Rating Rb


@OutOfScopeOfAlgorithm: 
  store each friends along with the counts of their hotness
  retrieve each friends with their hotness counts
  perform ranking function based on the hotness counts
  rank friends in descending order from hottest to not so hot

1: input friends
2: compare friend's hotness with other friend's hotness
3: rank friends with the most hotness based
4: 












// 
var rank = 0.00;
var Time = Date;
s = pics.
order = Math.log10([s.abs, 1].max);

if s > 0
  sign = 1
else if s < 0 
  sign = -1
else 
  sign = 0

td = (Time.now - post.created_at)

hot(ups, downs, date)
  var s = ups - downs
  var sign, date = Date, order
  order = Math.log10([s.abs, 1].max)
  if (s > 0)
    then sign = 1 
  else if (s < 0)
    then sign = -1
  else 
    sign = 0
  seconds = date.now - 
  (sign * order + seconds / 45000).sqrt(7)
