Facemash
==================================
Build a Complete NodeJS MVC Framework With powerful ExpressJS.
======================

The idea is to demonstrate a custom MVC architecture in the context of ExpressJS.

First I developed 'facemash' in php when i was a university student in 2013.
At the early days of 2016 i grew interest on NodeJS and decided to build a custom opinionated MVC framework on the top of powerful unopinionated expressJS.
So i thought lets develop 'facemash' for the 2nd time with this custom built framework.

## Installation

  - Download the source code.
  - create a mysql database named 'facemash' with username = 'root' & password = ''
  - Run "npm install"
  - Run "npm start"
  - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
