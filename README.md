# My version of Facemash.

This is a rewrite of [ecto / mugshot-wars](https://github.com/ecto/mugshot-wars) using MongoDB instead of Reddis and Jade templates instead of EJS.
The script uses the [elo rating algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to compute relative value of comparison. The original version of the
type of app goes back to Mark Zuckerberg's Facemash which was the predecessor to Facebook.

> According to The Harvard Crimson, Facemash "used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person".
