## My version of Facemash.

Let's get down to the history. What is Facemash? Facemash is a website that puts two random pictures of people
together and lets you vote for who's hotter based on their looks. Initially created by Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg 
for rating girls. The whole site was set up in one night and receives huge traffic which led to 22000 hits and eventually 
crash the howard network.

This is my hands-on project to get started in modern web technologies.

As you may know, Zuckerberg once created a website which compare girl with other girls when he was still a student at Harvard. The website was called **Facemash**, unfortunately the website was closed due to people privacy being violated.

The purpose of this project was to recreate **Facemash** minus the girl and stuff so all we have is the website and the algorithm.

I've seen a lot of recreation of Facemash, but most of them is in PHP and other language, I created this one with fully static web technology and use Firebase as a the database.


## What is StuckWanYah?
StuckWanYah ["Stak Wan Yah"] or "Stuck Wan"  is a pun used used explicitly for .
StuckWanYah is a pun for â€˜stak wanâ€™ [tok pisin]. The word has subtle meaningsâ€¦

This is a rewrite of [ecto / mugshot-wars](https://github.com/ecto/mugshot-wars) using MongoDB instead of Reddis and Jade templates instead of EJS.
The script uses the [elo rating algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to compute relative value of comparison. The original version of the type of app goes back to Mark Zuckerberg's Facemash which was the predecessor to Facebook.

> According to The Harvard Crimson, Facemash "used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person".
