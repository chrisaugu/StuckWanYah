  It's boring here. I need a idea to get active. my facebook profile is open up on my desktop and scrolling down
  my into some friends propic likes. Except enough I need an idea to do that.
  Zuckerberg from "the social media" gives me an idea of putting pictures of two
  people and let others vote for who's hotter.
  Yea, it's on. I'm not gonna do the same thing mark did. But i like the idea of manipulating third-party api
  and making everything a little ai in style. 
  first thing i will need is a lot of pictures from facebook. unfortunately facebook doesn't allow access to its database
  but the folks there made it easy for developers to use their service throught its graph api. great!
  i will use facebook's graph api to get friends age, propics and

  Next i will have to create a server to serve everything on the backend. Sounds like the job for nodejs

  I want something dynamic, say when I end open the page two random pictures will appear asking me to vote for who's hotter
  and then the next two random pictures appear again asking me to do the same thing I had just done. is perfect for ajax.
  But i like ruby so why don't i use mix match ajax on ruby on rails. GREAT!
